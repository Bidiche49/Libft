Here's a concise README for your `Libft` project:

# Libft

## Description

Libft is a custom C library that replicates standard C library functions along with some additional utility functions. This project is a foundational step in learning how to create and use your own library in C, enhancing your understanding of pointers, memory management, and function implementation.

## Features

- **Standard Library Functions**: Re-implementation of functions from `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`, and other standard headers.
- **Additional Utility Functions**: Custom utility functions to perform common tasks, such as string manipulation, linked list management, and memory allocation.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Encourages writing modular, reusable code with separate `.c` files for each function.

## Key Technologies

- **C Programming Language**: Core language used for developing low-level code.
- **Makefile**: Automates compilation and ensures the library is built efficiently.
- **Static Library (.a)**: Compilation of object files into a static library, allowing functions to be used across different programs.

## Learning Outcomes

- Deepened understanding of how the C standard library works internally.
- Gained experience in memory management, error handling, and pointer manipulation.
- Developed skills in creating reusable code modules and static libraries.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd libft
   ```
2. Compile the library:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. Include `libft.h` and link the compiled library in your projects.

## Compilation

To compile your project with libft:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o your_program your_program.c -L. -lft
```
